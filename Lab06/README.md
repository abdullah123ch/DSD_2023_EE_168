# Experiment 6: Sequential Circuit Design


This repository contains the RTL design, constraint file, and diagrams for a logic circuit implemented as part of Experiment 6.

## Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a given sequential circuit. The design process involved:

1. **RTL Design:** Writing the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) description of the circuit using SystemVerilog.
2. **Constraint File Creation:** Developing a constraint file (XDC format for Xilinx, or appropriate format for your target FPGA) to guide the synthesis and place-and-route process for the FPGA.  This file specifies timing constraints, pin assignments, and other crucial parameters.
3. **Diagram Creation:** Generating block diagrams and/or schematics to visually represent the circuit's architecture and data flow.

## Files Included

*   `Lab06.sv`: SystemVerilog RTL code for the logic circuit.
*   `constraints.xdc`: Constraint file for the target FPGA.
*   `lab06.svg`: Circuit diagram for the circuit.
